<h2> What Is Clean Code? </h2>
1- The code can be measured with either "good" or "bad" in the code review or by how many minutes it takes you to talk about it, so write clean code no matter how much time it takes time because in the future it will save your time whether by reducing bugs or by making it easy to fix bugs.

2- A clean code should be elegant, efficient, readable, simple, without duplications, and well-written and function should be doing exact things and we can clean our code by minimizing big functions into small functions.

3- Clean code offers quality and understanding when we open a class.

4- It is necessary that your code is clean and readable for anyone to find and easily understand. Avoid wasting others' time.

5- When you write a code you should think first before writing any code that will make your code cleaner and of course save your time.

6- After writing a code, imagine yourself after 3 months at least from now, would you understand this code? if yes it is mostly a clean code, if not you should try to clean it.

7- Always Keep the code simple and stupid. Simpler is always better. Reduce complexity as much as possible.

8- Boy scout rule. Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
