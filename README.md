<h2> What Is Clean Code? </h2>
1- The code can be measured with either "good" or "bad" in the code review or by how many minutes it takes you to talk about it, so write clean code no matter how much time it takes time because in the future it will save your time whether by reducing bugs or by making it easy to fix bugs.

2- A clean code should be elegant, efficient, readable, simple, without duplications, and well-written and function should be doing exact things and we can clean our code by minimizing big functions into small functions.

3- Clean code offers quality and understanding when we open a class.

4- It is necessary that your code is clean and readable for anyone to find and easily understand. Avoid wasting others' time.

5- When you write a code you should think first before writing any code that will make your code cleaner and of course save your time.

6- After writing a code, imagine yourself after 3 months at least from now, would you understand this code? if yes it is mostly a clean code, if not you should try to clean it.

7- Always Keep the code simple and stupid. Simpler is always better. Reduce complexity as much as possible.

8- Boy scout rule. Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.


<h2> Naming? </h2>

1- Don't use single-letter names in your code except in local variables inside short methods.

2- If a variable might be seen or used in multiple places in a body of code, it is imperative to give it a search-friendly name.

3- Avoid encoding, it just waste our time and there is enough encodings to deal with without adding more encoding.

4- Make meaningful distinction.

5- Use pronounceable and descriptive names so it doesn't cause errors when you try to call the name again and to facilitate communication.

6- Avoid acronyms and avoid confusing names, which may bring anyone who reads the code to the wrong conclusions.

<h2> Functions? </h2>
