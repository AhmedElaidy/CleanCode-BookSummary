What Is Clean Code?
The code can be measured with either "good" or "bad" in the code review or by how many minutes it takes you to talk about it.

A clean code should be elegant, efficient, readable, simple, without duplications, and well-written. 

You should add value to the business with your code.

Clean code offers quality and understanding when we open a class.

It is necessary that your code is clean and readable for anyone to find and easily understand. Avoid wasting others' time.
